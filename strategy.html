        <h2>PIVOT is uniquely positioned to assist CEOs and senior teams create lasting, high impact change.</h2>

        <p>We understand business transformation and have the capabilities to support every step of the transformation process. Through our experience, we have also developed an intimate understanding of the dynamics of organizational change and of the right conditions for successful business transformation.</p> 

        <p>When we think of business transformations, we often think of the more dramatic examples where transformations are triggered by a major event, such as a disruption in the industry, a dramatic loss of competitiveness, a change of CEO or a major strategic combination (merger & acquisition), which represent a major break from the past and is imposed to the organization. (e.g. RIM/Blackberry). However, in many cases, business transformations are triggered by more subtle symptoms signaling that your organization is no longer adapted to its business environment: Performance is slipping, strategies are no longer delivering the expected growth. You question whether you have the right leadership team, talent and culture to succeed. Something does’nt quite feel right in your gut but you can’t exactly put your finger on it.</p>

        <p>When confronted with this situation, leaders can either ignore the signals and continue to do more of the same, or recognize that the organization has reached a ‘pivot point’ and that they need to refresh their strategies, realign their organization and revitalize their leadership capabilities to break out of their current pattern and reach new levels of performance. <a href="">See: What sets strategic transformations apart </a> </p>
